England take on Jamaica in a three-match series starting on Wednesday 11 January, and the BBC has live coverage of all the matches.

The series forms part of the Roses' preparations for July's World Cup in South Africa.

The series opener is at Manchester's AO Arena with the remaining fixtures at London's Copper Box on 14 and 15 January.

England and Jamaica are third and fourth in the world, respectively.

The two sides last met in 2021 when England emerged 2-1 series winners, but the side is much changed since then following the retirements of captain Serena Guthrie and key defenders Eboni Usoro-Brown and Stacey Francis-Bayman.

England will hope to start 2023 in positive fashion following a year in which they were unable to retain the Commonwealth title.

After a difficult campaign in Birmingham, where they finished fourth, the Roses hosted a successful 3-0 series win against Uganda before losing all three of their Test matches against Australia in November.

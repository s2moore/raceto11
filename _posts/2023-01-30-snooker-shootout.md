It's fair to say that this is a unique format that provides both players, fans and spectators with an experience akin to that of a darts match.

Matches last a maximum of ten minutes.  

There's a shot clock. Fifteen seconds for the first five minutes and ten seconds for the last five minutes. 

Pressure is on players to the delight of the crowd revelling in fantastic shot making and player misfortune in equal measures.

The shoot out is a world ranking event.  Unbelievably, the shoot out trophy has yet to be lifted by a player ranked in the top 16!

Matches often hang in the balance up to the final seconds.  However, clearences can be made in the pressure as evidenced by Chris Wakelin in this years final.  A fantastic clearence under the pressure for the player who was ranked 47 in the world going into the tournament.  Wakelin collecting £50,000 for the victory and an additional £5000 for the highest break of the tournament, 119, produced in the final.
